# SmallLang
An esoteric Language I found from 2017... just prints using + and .

## Run
just run the py. Can either be a shell (`python3 small.py`) or run a file (`python3 small.py hello.small`)

## Generate
Just run the py. Can either be a shell (`python3 generator.py`), run a file (`python3 generator.py hello.txt`), or just pass the text (`python3 generator.py "hello world"`)

I added slashed for optimization and comments.

I honestly don't care lol. Just thought I would do it
